This is a multimodal machine learning model that takes in accelerometer and GPS data from sensors on subjects' upper arms and categorizes their activity into one of six categories.
This project was competed for the 14:332:493:06 Machine Learning for Internet of Things class at rutgers university by Gunjan Adya and Melis Durgut. Our paper detaling our findings comparing the performance of models using a CNN alone, an LSTM alone, and a combination of these two architectures can be found as "ML4IoT_finalPaper.pdf."
This project was made using the help of the RealWorld DataSet made publicly available by the Universtiy of Mannheim (https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/projects/activity-recognition/dataset/dataset-realworld/).
